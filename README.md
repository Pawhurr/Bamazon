# Bamazon

## Welcome to Bamazon!

This node application has two views, Customer View and Manager View.

In Customer View, run `node bamazonCustomer.js` and you will see a selection of items for sale.  Choose an item to purchase and enter a quantity that you would like to buy.  The app will give you your total and deduct the amount you purchased from the database.  If your selected amount is more than the inventory available, the sale doesn't go through.

In Manager View, you can choose to see what is for sale, see what inventory is low, add to the current stock level of any of the products, and add new products to the sale list.
